## Cross-site scripting - XSS

### Definition
- There is not restricted in JavaScript
- Attackers insert a script in a website with any scripting language

### Type
> *easy to hard*

1. Stored XSS
    - Can be executed by POST request
    - e.g., Blog post comments
2. Reflected XSS
    - Send a with exploited URL an email to victim
    - Need to social engineering first
3. DOM-XSS
    - e.g., Client-side JavaScript
    - Get access to the website document object model
        - e.g., Session ID
    - DOM sync

## How it works?

Victim get into a trap by going to that target website. The malicious code will be run automatically on client side. For example, a key logger insert into client computer and send all the information from victim device.

### Techniques
- Stripping
    - put ***XSS*** to break HTML comment and insert malicious codes
    - `-->` & `"` &
    - `<script> blah blah blah </script>`
    - JavaScript Event handler `<img src=x onerror=alert()>`
    
- Add x-cross-site scripting protection header
- AngularJS - vulnerable version
    - Insert ***XSS*** with `{{}}`
- `document.write()`
    - one of the DOM-XSS vulnerabilities
