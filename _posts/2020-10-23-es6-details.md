This is a brief summary for the ES6 features.

***
#### Arrow Function
```javascript
  (parameters)=>{
    console.log("comments");
  }
```
It is different with regular function in JavaScript
that is an alternative way to address the **this** scope problem.

Many JavaScript developer should face the **this** scope issue.
We can use arrow function keep the **this** point and stick to its parent.

#### Spread Operator
```javascript
  let arrayA = [1,2,3];
  console.log(...arrayA); // result: an array
  
  let arrayB = ['Tom','Jerry'];
  console.log(...arrayB); // result: Tom Jerry
  
  let arrayC = ['I','go','to'];
  let arrayD = [...arrayC,'school','by','bus'];
  console.log(...arrayD); // result: I go to school by bus
```
It is simple and useful for combine multiple arrays. 

In the past, people can use concat to combine these two arrays but spread operator do it more directly.
