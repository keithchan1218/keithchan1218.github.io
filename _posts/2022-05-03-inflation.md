Briefly share about inflation and solution

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)
This is the most easiest way to determine inflation. CPI reflects the daily expense of the local market. For example, we can bought an orange🍊 with **$2** each last 10 years ago but average orange🍊 price is **$5** now. Consumer need to pay more than before for having an orange🍊.
