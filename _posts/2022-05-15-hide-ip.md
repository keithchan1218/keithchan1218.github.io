This article shows you how to hide your internet footprint with a VPN.

***

## Introduction

You may ask why do we need to hide on the internet? You may not care about your information. 

**Shoulder Surfing** - What if someone looks over your mobile next to you? Do you feel uncomfortable, right?

**Personal Information** - Most of us ignore the importance of privacy. We can be targeted by threat actors. For example, they can capture your web activities such as e-banking and social media.

If you don't want to be one of the victims, it is better to learn something new to protect yourself and your family.

## VPN

**VPN**  = Virtual **Private** Network

VPN is the easiest solution for users to protect their privacy in internet activities. There are some common and widely used VPN providers: 

- ProtonVPN
- TunnelBear
- NordVPNüí≤
- Surfsharküí≤

Most of them are expensive around 10 USD per month. We don't want to spend that much money on it. So, making your own VPN may be suitable for you.

## Runbook: Build your travel router (+VPN)

*Hardware Requirements: Raspberry Pi 4, Network Adapter*

It is easy to make your travel VPN with a Raspberry Pi 4 (üçí). OpenWrt is an open-source OS for routers. We can make a üçí router with OpenWrt.

<br/>

### Step 1: Install OpenWrt image

- Download the image which fits your device. In this tutorial, Rasp4 model B is used: [OpenWrt images for Raspberry Pi](https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi)
- Write the image on the SD card by using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe)

<br/>

### Step 2: Connect the OpenWrt

Connect your computer and üçí with an Ethernet cable
We need manual set up our IP address at the very first step. After the following steps, we can get access to the router.

- Go to: `Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center`
- Find the OpenWrt network (Ethernet connection)
- Change the TCP/IPv4 from automatically to manual IP address
    - IP address: 192.168.1.10
    - Default gateway: 192.168.1.1
- Connect the router via SSH
    - `ssh root@192.168.1.1`
- Change the password
    - `passwd`

<br/>

### Step 3: Backup

Before we start editing the configuration of the router, a backup is needed for recovery from error settings.

`/etc/config`

```sh
cp firewall firewall.bk
cp wireless wireless.bk
cp network network.bk
```

<br/>

### Step 4: DHCP from Public Wi-Fi

LuCI, the web interface, can simplify the whole process. We use it to scan the public Wi-Fi. After that, the router gets the IP address from the public Wi-Fi through DHCP.

- Login to the router website
- Go to `wireless` and scan the public Wi-Fi
- Replace the default Wi-Fi config with the selected Wi-Fi

The details can be found on their [official website](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/luci/start)

<br/>

### Step 5: Install packages for the network adapter

Some packages are required to recognize our network adapter.

```sh
opkg update
opkg install kmod-rt2800-lib kmod-rt2800-usb kmod-rt2x00-lib kmod-rt2x00-usb kmod-usb-core kmod-usb-uhci kmod-usb-ohci kmod-usb2 usbutils
```

<br/>

### Step 6: Setup Travel Wi-Fi

We can find our network adapter Wi-Fi after enabling the interface.

- Plug your network adapter
- Enable the network interface: `ifconfig wlan1 up`
- Enable the travel Wi-Fi (radio1)

 It is a default OpenWrt Wi-Fi. So, we should add the PSK encryption and password for our travel Wi-Fi.

```sh
option encryption 'psk2'
option key 'your-wifi-password'
```

<br/>

### Step 7: Setup OpenVPN

That's not enough for our security purpose. The public Wi-Fi provider can still capture our network traffic. So, we need to use OpenVPN as our VPN service.

```sh
opkg install openvpn-openssl luci-app-openvpn
```

We use [VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/) as our example:
- Download their OpenVPN client config file from the website
- Upload it to the OpenWrt by entering the OpenVPN tab
- Click `Enable` and `Save & Apply`

You may face connection problems. There are several reasons that may affect the VPN connection as follows:

1. The VPN server is offline
2. The VPN interface firewall rules haven't been set up properly
3. Interface setting error between Home/Public Wifi

`radio0 interface`
```
option channel '7'
option short_gi_40 '0'
```

Notes
- Kill switch
    - if not, leak privacy (e.g. IP Address)
- Proxy (HIA, ANM, NOA)
