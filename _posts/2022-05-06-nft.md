For example, Ethereum is the leading **"Altcoin"** which is crypto other than Bitcoin.

In a normal capital market, Customers or merchants need to pay the transaction fee by using a credit card (e.g., Visa) or other digital payment methods. In the crypto world, we call it **gas fee**üíµ. Users need to pay the gas fee for the miners who help support the blockchain network with their computer processing power. It is the only cost when using crypto to perform trading.
